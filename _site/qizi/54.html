        <p>The author has something to say:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Before, there were always readers who questioned why injected-with-Embers Ling Xiao couldn’t beat Ying Feng, yet yesterday’s injected-with-Embers Zhu Yue could beat Zhen He; this point has already been very clearly addressed in the original text. By the time Ling Xiao faced Ying Feng, the Embers drug was already wearing off, and it was under the circumstances of side effects + heavy injuries that he held the Adult Ceremony with Ying Feng.</li>
  <li>
    <div>There are people who think Zhu Yue and Zhen He getting together is god logic / improvised / <div class="tooltip">Lalang Pei<span class="tooltiptext">A folk saying that refers to forcing pair of people who have no feelings together</span></div>. The foreshadow for Zhen He's fate appeared in <div class="tooltip">chapter 22<span class="tooltiptext">Refer to <a href="https://www.ainushi.com/2018/08/qz-chapter-22/" target="_blank">chapter 22 on Ainushi's site</a></span></div> and the hints given in the narration occurred even earlier: The Qizhu is not necessarily the <div class="tooltip">gong<span class="tooltiptext">top</span></div>, and this is definitely not referring to virgin Ping Zong.</div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There was a special training assignment today. The instructor arrived at the drill grounds early in the morning to set up the place, then saw Ling Xiao and Ying Feng in the middle of their morning run. Ling Xiao was running along much farther ahead and Ying Feng stopped when he saw him.</p>

<p>“You two sure work hard enough,” the instructor expressed amazement, “But didn’t I say that in terms of physical fitness, the both of you already have more than enough to deal with the entrance exams?”</p>

<p>“It’s Ling Xiao’s personal requirement.” Ying Feng also stepped to the side, watching together with the instructor as the silhouette in motion sprinted along the athletic track. After deciding to take the exams, Ling Xiao treated his Qizhu as a future rival and didn’t lower his own requirements just because he was a Qizi.</p>

<p>“Recently, he runs every morning, works on special spiritual training during the day, real combat skills in the evening, and then when he returns he continues to read history books late into the night.” Nearly every night, he needed to employ some coercive means before he agreed to turn off the lights.</p>

<p>The instructor nodded in appreciation and said, “Ling Xiao is exceptionally gifted. It’s rare to see someone with outstanding innate talent also work as hard as he does. Over the past many years, he has always aimed to surpass you. There were a few times that I’ve accidentally run into him training alone late at night on the eve of the exam, and on the next day after the exam was over, when he would ask me who had the higher scores between the two of you, I never have the heart to break it to him. In fact, placed in any class year, he could’ve come out on top with his capabilities, but it just so happened he encountered you in this class year.”</p>

<p>Ling Xiao just finished running a lap and came up to the two of them, asking, “What are you both chatting about?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” the instructor hurriedly changed the topic, “Ying Feng just said you read books until late at night each day. In fact, reading books is certainly not the only channel to studying history, visiting a history museum can also be very beneficial.”</p>

<p>“Museum?” Ling Xiao’s eyes lit up; as a matter of fact, after immersing in the bitter hardship of studying these past few days, his view on history has changed greatly and he no longer thought this subject matter was dry and boring–on the contrary, he even took some interest in it. On hearing there was a museum to visit, he promptly cast eyes towards Ying Feng, his intentions written clearly on his face.</p>

<p>“Let’s go.” Ying Feng turned to leave while Ling Xiao bid farewell to the instructor and quickly followed. The instructor gazed at their receding backs and breathed a sigh of relief; that he couldn’t become a Qizhu admittedly was a pity but it seemed like he already found his new path forward.</p>

<p>The history museum the instructor mentioned was not at all far from Bikong; it only took a little effort to drive and then they were there. The museum was open to the public for tours and didn’t need tickets for entry.</p>

<p>This museum did not divide the display areas by era, but rather by type. Ling Xiao studied the floor plan and decided to start the tour from the top floor pertaining to military affairs and politics.</p>

<p>Once he got to the top floor, his line of sight was immediately drawn to the busts on each side of the long corridor. These statues were made by later generations, and in front of the base of each statue, a glass showcase was arranged, and in it displayed the dagger once used by that person while below was an engraving of their life story.</p>

<p>Ling Xiao who had been hard-at-work studying history for the past several consecutive days was finally no longer utterly unfamiliar with these famous historical figures when he saw them, and recognized the first person at the front right away.</p>

<p>“I know him, he’s the one who overthrew the emperor’s rule, the Grand Marshal who founded the republic. The first year of the new calendar refers to the year he founded the country.”</p>

<p>Ying Feng let out a dull hum of approval, affirming that his recitation of common history knowledge from first-year textbooks was accurate.</p>

<p>Ling Xiao acquired “Ying Feng-style encouragement”, and with great enthusiasm, went down the line talking about one after the other until the ones behind he could recognize became fewer and fewer, so then Ying Feng took over to give him an explanation, one by one.</p>

<p>After walking through the long corridor, it was almost as if they witnessed Tianxiu’s history one-time, and at the very end of it, there were still a certain number of seats left vacant. Ling Xiao thought with mixed feelings: “If my bust can also appear here in the future, then this life also won’t be considered a waste.”</p>

<p>“We are naturally always constantly sleeping and waking up, how do you know there is no you in front of you?”</p>

<p>The question woke Ling Xiao up and he looked back, only to feel that every portrait had become more vivid and familiar. Every person might possibly be from the same era as him, might possibly be a needed hero to look up to, but also might be a close companion, a comrade-in-arms, or even an intimate family member–they may even be himself–thinking this way, it seemed as if the estrangement of time ceased to exist.</p>

<p>“You are absolutely right, maybe who’s in here is not only me, but also you, too.” He took a look around in all directions, and finally pointed to the founding Grand Marshal, “I think this one looks quite like you.”</p>

<p>Ying Feng silently attached the three words “face blindness disorder” he read from a foreign planet’s medical book onto Ling Xiao. It looked like there was yet another sickness that Tianxiu people can suffer from.</p>

<p>If the face blindness disorder were real, then what Ling Xiao said about how there was a first-grade Nestling at school who looked like an ancestor of the Tianxiu people also couldn’t be entirely trustworthy.</p>

<p>“Ah,” At this time, Ling Xiao suddenly pointed to the front, “Isn’t that person Xing Lou?”</p>

<p>Ying Feng followed where he pointed and looked over to see a single person standing forlornly next to the most central showcase in the hall; he didn’t seem like the typical tourist that bent over to scrutinize the piece in detail, rather, it seemed as if nearly his whole person was pressed up close to the display case, with a raised right hand that was even more glued onto the glass.</p>

<p>He was looking down at the cultural relics displayed inside, and rather than say he appeared to be sight-seeing, it was better to say he appeared to be mourning; there was an indescribable emotion flowing in his eyes–but a person definitely would not show this sort of expression towards an emotionless object.</p>

<p>“Xing Lou!” Ling Xiao’s voice was particularly loud and clear in the spacious and quiet museum, and Xing Lou’s hand shot off the glass as if electrocuted, his body also following suit, taking a huge step back and forcing some distance between him and the display case.</p>

<div>After clearly spotting the person who shouted his name, he let out a docile and harmless smile, “<div class="tooltip">Ling Xiao Xuezhang<span class="tooltiptext">Senior Ling Xiao</span></div>.”</div>
<p />

<p>Xing Lou’s abnormal behavior just now was not at all noticed by Ling Xiao; instead, to run into a person he recognized here only made him feel like it was fate, “Are you here for a visit too?”</p>

<p>Xing Lou responded, “The teacher mentioned this place in history class so I came to take a look out of curiosity.”</p>

<p>After he finished saying this sentence, he shifted his attention to the person next to Ling Xiao. Ling Xiao was suddenly very nervous–if the other party were to ask about Ying Feng, there was absolutely no way he could be like other Qizi and generously introduce this man as his Qizhu.</p>

<p>But fortunately, Xing Lou’s eyes merely swept over him before they were retracted and not at all did he bring up the question that would make Ling Xiao feel embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Xuezhang, I already finished looking around this floor. You should continue exploring, I’m going downstairs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, okay.” Seeing he said it that way, Ling Xiao just nodded and said goodbye.</p>

<div>When Xing Lou brushed past Ying Feng, he unconsciously slowed down a step, and the both of them turned their heads slightly, their eyes indistinctly <div class="tooltip">scanning the other's body<span class="tooltiptext">Literally, their eyes 绕了一圈, so it means they circled around the other party's body once</span></div>, but then instantly turned away again.</div>
<p />

<p>Xing Lou walked farther and farther away and Ying Feng also did not look back, the distance between their backs gradually expanding, but Ling Xiao followed him with his eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>“Strange, I saw a restored portrait on TV the other day and thought it looked exactly like him, but after seeing him again today, I don’t think they look so alike anymore.”</p>

<div>“No, although it's somewhat of an exaggeration to say they look exactly the same, they still have a 70-80% resemblance,” Ying Feng reevaluated <div class="tooltip">his<span class="tooltiptext">Ling Xiao</span></div> face blindness severity, dropping it by one level, “But there are also a lot of people who look alike, it's just a coincidence.”</div>
<p />

<p>For example, him and the principal’s Qizhu whom he never met.</p>

<p>“What was he looking at just now? He was so fascinated by it.” Ling Xiao also ran over to see the showcase at the center. The cultural relic displayed inside was only the size of his palm. From an ancient era and having been severely corroded, it was an insignia he could vaguely make out.</p>

<p>To the side of the showcase, there was a 3D projection of what should be the restored cultural relic, allowing people to clearly see its original appearance. It had the outline of a hexagram with intricate designs engraved in the middle, the most obvious of which was a crown.</p>

<p>“This is the insignia of the ancient royal family,” Ling Xiao read the description, “It has more than 4,000 years of history and is one of the oldest cultural relics so far.” He felt rueful after reading it, “That things 4,000 years ago can still be preserved so well, we can clearly see civilization back then was very advanced.”</p>

<p>“Is he really only a first grader?” Ying Feng suddenly asked.</p>

<p>“Of course, why do you ask that?”</p>

<p>“His eyes don’t look like a Nestling’s.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you didn’t see the face he had when he was scared to death by a spider.” Ling Xiao thought it was funny when he recalled the situation, “But what should a Nestling’s eyes look like?” He only knew what color a Nestling’s eyes should look like.</p>

<p>Ying Feng did not continue to express his opinions. After the two of them finished touring the current floor, they arrived at the floor below which displayed folk artifacts.</p>

<p>The exhibit for folk artifacts was evidently not as solemn and serene as the top floor, with soft lighting and soothing music playing in the background.</p>

<div>“<div class="tooltip">Si, Nian, Stone<span class="tooltiptext">I'll keep the pinyin of the first two characters, 思 and 念, when referring to this stone. "Missing" or "Thinking Of" Stone don't capture the meaning in English well. Maybe "Yearning". The meaning of this stone will be explained later ^^.</span></div>.” Ling Xiao read out the name of the historical relic in front of him.</div>
<p />

<p>He looked down and as it turned out, this stone was not one piece but rather a row, from left to right of approximately ten or so more. Each stone’s surface was engraved with ancient characters he did not understand and in front of each laid a label with an age.</p>

<p>Only then did he notice these stones were not at all unearthed as one batch and even the estimated eras were different. From the leftmost one that dated as far back as 4,000 years ago, the later to the era the newer it was, all the way until the rightmost one, where its marked age was surprisingly 70-80 years ago.</p>

<p>“In the ordinary course of events, objects within the last 100 years should not be classified as historical artifacts, but this type of collection is the only exception in this building. The existence of the Sinian Stone, from several thousand years ago to several decades ago, has spanned a considerably large time frame and already surpasses those of cultural relics. To this day, it still remains an unsolved mystery in the study of history.”</p>

<p>Ling Xiao lifted his head and saw the museum staff who gave the explanation, standing courteously to the side.</p>

<p>“Can I ask what these stones are about?”</p>

<p>“These ancient artifacts that come from different time periods possess the same distinctive feature, and that is, they have the exact same characters carved onto them. When historians discovered the first Sinian Stone, they thought it was just an ordinary rock engraved with an ancient saying, but after finding the second, and then the third in succession, people realized that these rocks weren’t nearly as simple as they thought.”</p>

<p>“There is no one that can live for thousands of years,” Ling Xiao said, “The characters on these stones were probably carved on by different people. Take the most recent one for example, as long as it’s someone who’s dropped by the museum, anyone can copy it.”</p>

<p>“In theory this is the case, that’s why the discovery of the most recent stone led to a fairly large controversy, because cultural knowledge of the Sinian Stone was already widespread and there were numerous imitations. But after repeated inspections by forensic graphologists, whether through the perspective of handwriting habits or carving techniques, the characters on these stones are all from the same person–this is the true inconceivable aspect of the Sinian Stone.”</p>

<p>“It’s so magical?” On hearing this, Ling Xiao was stunned, “Then what the heck is written on it?”</p>

<p>“It’s a type of old expression, it’s pronounced Oh Samisuka. Translated into modern language, it means I miss you.”</p>

<p>“Oh Samishuka,” Ling Xiao repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Ling Xiao recited it silently twice again, thinking it sounded pretty good, then he turned his head to see that Ying Feng who was there just now had already gone to another display case, probably not interested in this sort of content.</p>

<p>“The museum has opened this service where interested tourists can carve their own Sinian Stone. We will send it to your partner through a time machine.”</p>

<p>“Time machine?”</p>

<p>The staff smiled, “It’s not the type you are imagining, we’ll properly take care of your Sinian Stone, and then three, five, or maybe ten years later, we’ll send it to your reserved terminal number.”</p>

<p>“So that’s how,” Ling Xiao thought, “It’s not like I have anyone I miss so no thanks.”</p>

<p>“Not missing them today doesn’t mean you won’t miss them in the future. The Sinian Stone is currently a very popular token for expressing love. The interpretation of it is: ‘I wish to spend every single of every hour with you’, and even intimate lovers will select this meaningful type of gift to leave a small surprise for their partner in the future.”</p>

<p>Ling Xiao couldn’t help but admit he was very good at marketing and he was even a bit moved by his pitch. He had no lover now, but since his own life managed to turn upside down within ten days, won’t the next ten years also be one long and endless turbulence?</p>

<p>“Okay then,” he agreed, “I’ll carve one too.”</p>

<p>The staff chose a stone for him and provided a writing sample of the old expression. Ling Xiao took out his own dagger, and carving onto the surface, copied it stroke by stroke.</p>

<p>“Done.” He handed the finished product over to the staff. The other party smiled as he received it, then his expression froze.</p>

<p>“The handwriting you imitated looks so real.”</p>

<p>“Really? Maybe it’s influenced by what I saw just now.”</p>

<p>The staff nodded in agreement, “I’ll help you take good care of it. Have you picked the date for sending it?”</p>

<p>“The one that’s the farthest away.” Ling Xiao swiped his card. He hesitated when it was time to register a terminal number, but finally filled in Ying Feng’s.</p>

<div>Ten years......If the <div class="tooltip">awakening plan<span class="tooltiptext">Refers to the plan to awaken Yue Ying</span></div> can succeed, at that time the blood contract between him and Ying Feng should be removed, so it's ok to treat this as a goodbye gift for him.</div>
<p />

<p>As soon as he finished writing, Ying Feng returned, “What are you fooling around with now?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” Ling Xiao hurriedly stuffed the thing back to the staff, “Just buying some souvenirs.”</p>

<p>Ying Feng looked at his empty hands and honestly didn’t think these words held any credibility.</p>

<p>Ling Xiao really did develop an interest for the museum and actually stayed in it for a whole day. Ying Feng thought after he returned, he would go back to the dorm to rest but the other party asked to go to the training hall to exercise “for a little while.”</p>

<p>After “a little while”, Ling Xiao was on the floor soaked in sweat, and even Ying Feng was forced to sit on the ground, panting.</p>

<p>Ling Xiao managed to stabilize his breathing with difficulty, “Let’s take a break and go again.”</p>

<p>“Again?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t train at all today and will waste another whole day donating blood tomorrow. If I don’t continue to work hard, I’ll be left behind by other people.”</p>

<p>Ying Feng couldn’t help but ask, “Do you need to be so intense like this?”</p>

<p>Lying flat on the floor, Ling Xiao raised one hand, holding up a tiny distance between his thumb and index finger.</p>

<p>“Look, this was me and you in the past, the gap between us was only this small. I always thought that with a little more effort, I’d surpass you.”</p>

<p>He widened the gap between his thumb and index finger completely, “This is you and me now. The gap between us is so large that no matter how hard I try to catch up, I’m still far behind.”</p>

<p>He put his hand down, stared straight at the ceiling, and calmly said, “Ying Feng, I will never catch up to you in this lifetime, but no matter whether it was back then or now, my heart that wants to cut down the gap still hasn’t changed. Regardless of whether the gap is a finger or a pinch, I’ll still do my best to get close to where you are up ahead.”</p>

<p>Ying Feng was silent for quite a while, then stood up from the floor and extended a hand towards him.</p>

<p>Ling Xiao gripped his hand back and Ying Feng exerted force, pulling him off the floor.</p>

<p>He took a step back and showed a ready position towards Ling Xiao.</p>

<p>“Bring it.”</p>
