message: "I'm quite curious about the Yuji's pair. Gotta wonder if the reason their in the joint department was in order to fix their relationship, unlike others. \r\nIt's two star.\r\nMy first thought was, \"there was someone even more stubborn than Ling Xiao and rejected his Qizhu's help!\" \r\nOf course there was chances of Yuji unwilling to help in the first place. Hope to learn more about them! \r\nI do think the two pair got the hardest assignment at the moment, though the rest of the class may disagree with me. \r\nThanks for the chapters!"
