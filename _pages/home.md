Hi! I can read and speak some Cantonese (idioms kill me), so I wanted to try translating a novel I recently liked! I'll do my best to update weekly, enjoy and please support the author! âœ¨

If you see any mistakes, feel free to [fix it on your own](https://github.com/tamathecat/tamathecat.github.io/pulls) or [talk about it](https://github.com/tamathecat/tamathecat.github.io/issues), I'll take a look. If you don't feel comfortable on Github, feel free to DM me on Twitter. Also, if you see changes since your last visit, it's cause I can't make up my mind on how to best translate something and have been mulling over it ^^.
