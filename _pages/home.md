Hi there. I can read some Chinese (idioms kill me) and speak Cantonese, so I wanted to try translating a novel I recently liked! I'll do my best to update weekly, enjoy and please support the author! âœ¨

Note: If you see any mistakes (grammar, spelling, Xing Ling Xiao Lou mix up haha), feel free to [create a pull request to fix it on your own](https://github.com/tamathecat/tamathecat.github.io/pulls) or [make an issue to talk about it](https://github.com/tamathecat/tamathecat.github.io/issues) and I'll take a look. Or reach out to my Twitter and DM me ^^
