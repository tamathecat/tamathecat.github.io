Hi there! I can only speak Cantonese and English, and can read some Chinese (idioms kill me), so I wanted to try translating a novel I recently liked! I'll do my best to update weekly, enjoy and please support the author! âœ¨

Note: I'll be reworking this website slowly, so you may see changes! Also, if you see any mistakes (grammar, spelling, Xing Lou should not be Ling Xing LOL), feel free to open a pull request or issue and I'll take a look.
