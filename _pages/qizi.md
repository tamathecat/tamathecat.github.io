契子 by 易修罗

### Novel Updates Summary
On the distant Tianxiu Planet, there exists a group of unusual and intelligent beings. They consist of neither children nor elders. They have neither birth nor real death. They are born into the world through an extremely special process and have managed to keep their fundamental memories of survival through their endless reincarnations.

They are the Tianxiu people.

For every Tianxiu person, if they find someone they like and want to bind as partners with each other — then they would have to go through a life or death Adult Ceremony. The winner of the ceremony will become the absolute dominant in this spousal relationship.

While the defeated one will be referred to as -- Qizi.
