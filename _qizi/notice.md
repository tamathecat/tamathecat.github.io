Hello! ðŸ™ˆ Where has time gone? After rereading past chapters again, I'm quite motivated to go back, make edits, and translate more chapters~ But uh, so there is _one_ sliiiight problem: the unfinished 65 draft is on a laptop in another state right now though, so I'm going to go ahead and do 66 and 67 first, oops. This is what I get for not using Google docs properly T_T I guess I could retranslate, but it'll drive me crazy when I can't figure out what I settled on in that draft. If you have been waiting, please expect new chapters in the next month~ Hopefully it'll be a good bulk update <3
